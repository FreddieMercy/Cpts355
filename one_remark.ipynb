    "**Weight:** This assignment will count for approximately 5% of your final grade.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will explore use of some of the features of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acquiring the initial IPython notebook file\n",
    "This assignment itself is your starting ipython notebook file. Download the file by right-clicking on the downward pointing arrow icon at the top right of this page and selecting \"Save Link As\". Store the file where it is accessible to your running IPython notebook program. And then use the file list on the Dashboard, or File menu to open it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In accordance with the instructions for turning in the assignment the thing you turn in is to be named `one.ipynb`. Use \"Make a copy...\" on the File menu to make a copy of this file and then \"Rename...\" on the File menu to make its name be `one` (the `.ipynb` suffix will be added automatically).   \n",

    "\n",
    "**Note the following directions carefully.** Points will be deducted for incorrectly named files and functions. All the problem solutions should be placed in a single file named `one.ipynb`. When you are done and certain that everything is working correctly, turn in your file by uploading on the [course turn-in](http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~hauser/cs355/turnin.html) page. I repeat, the file that you upload must be named `one.ipynb`. Be sure to include your name in the first cell of the file. You may turn in your assignment as many times as you like. Only the last one submitted will be graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement your code for Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work you turn in is to be **your own personal work.** You may **not** copy another student's code or work together on writing code. You may not copy code from the web, or anything else that lets you avoid solving the problems for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will be marked for good programming style (appropriate algorithms, good indentation and appropriate comments -- refer to the [Python style guide](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v1/url?u=http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html&k=EWEYHnIvm0nsSxnW5y9VIw%3D%3D%0A&r=eeGljI9zw5gpItgZcG1FJb0lhuP4N9HYnT2rD7WAdC4%3D%0A&m=L8PrRa18UgLXP8Hrkq0dXrh8oiP%2B1tMYu5JO7k6O7Mk%3D%0A&s=c04949e849ed5bd9000c30f1f3fe0d2a41dcbaac28afdb2dfea7c6156bed4c81) -- as well as thoroughness of testing and clean and correct execution. The points below add up to 90%. The remaining 10% of the credit will be for the thoroughness of your testing. We will discuss in class what I'm expecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Good python style favors `for` loops rather than `while` loops (when possible) for reasons discussed in class.\n",
    "* Also, code to do the same thing (or something easily parameterizable) at different points in a program should not be duplicated but extracted into a callable function.\n",
    "* Turning in \"final\" code that produces debugging output is bad form, and points will be deducted. Here's a trick. Near the top of your program write a debug function that can be turned on and off by changing a single variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "    debugging = True\n",
    "    def debug(*s): if debugging: print(*s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you want to produce debugging output use `debug(\"This is my debugging output\")` instead of `print`. (How it works: Using `*` in front of the **parameter** of a function means that a variable number of **arguments** can be passed to that parameter when the function is called. Then using `*s` as `print`'s argument passes along those arguments to `print` which itself takes a variable number of arguments.) "

    "## Warmup -- makettable() and trans() -- 30%\n",
    "The text of a message can be hidden by applying a translation function to each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function `makettable(s1,s2)` that returns a dictionary such that each character in `s1` is mapped to the character at the corresponding position in `s2`. You may assume that the characters in `s1` are unique and that the two strings are the same length. (When I say \"you may assume X\" it means that your code does not have to check whether X holds or not). So for example, `makettable('abcdefg', 'gfedcba')` returns `{'a': 'g', 'c': 'e', 'b': 'f', 'e': 'c', 'd': 'd', 'g': 'a', 'f': 'b'}` Important note: throughout the class, when I say a function returns a value, I do not mean that it prints the value. Please pay attention to the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, define a function `trans(ttable, s)`. `trans` translates its string argument, `s`, according to its translation table argument, `ttable`. Argument `ttable` is, of course, a dictionary returned by the `makettable` function, and the result of `trans` is obtained by replacing each character, `c`, of `s` by `ttable[c]`, if `c` is amongst the keys of the `ttable`. If however `c` is not in `ttable.keys()` then it is unchanged in the output. This is all harder to describe than to do! To easily look up `k` in dictionary, `D`, specifying that the same character is to be used if it is not present as a key in the dictionary you can use\n",
    "```\n",
